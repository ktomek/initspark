# InitSpark

**InitSpark** is a lightweight, coroutine-based startup orchestration library for Kotlin applications. It provides a structured way to declare, sequence, and execute initialization tasks (called *sparks*) during your app's startup phase.

## Features

- üî• Declarative DSL to define sparks
- ‚è±Ô∏è Time tracking for individual sparks and phases
- ‚öôÔ∏è Support for `await`, `track`, and `spark` styles:
  - `await`: sequential execution
  - `track`: asynchronous with completion tracking
  - `spark`: fire-and-forget
- üå≤ Dependency management between sparks
- üß™ Built-in testing support
- üìä Access to performance metrics via `SparkTimer`

## Getting Started

```kotlin
val config = buildSparks {
    await { SparkLogger() }
    async("LoadPrefs") { LoadPreferencesSpark() }
    spark("WarmUp") { WarmUpCacheSpark() }
}
```

Then run with:

```kotlin
val initSpark = InitSpark(config, CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default))
initSpark.initialize()
```

## Spark Types

- `await {}`: runs sequentially, blocks next spark until finished
- `async(key) {}`: runs in parallel, sets `isInitialized` when done
- `spark(key) {}`: runs in parallel without tracking

## Timing API

Track execution times with:

```kotlin
val duration = initSpark.timing.get(mySpark)
val totalTime = initSpark.timing.total()
```
